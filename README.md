# brokenray
Broken Ray transform tools

Provides numerical inversions for the Florescu, Markel, and Schotland Broken Ray transform,
[1], and the Polar Broken Ray transform, [2].

The brokenray module provides two submodules, florescu and polar, and can also be invoked at
the command line.

Also provided are some SAGE worksheets. The worksheet 'fmsbrt-stage1.sws' is used to generate
the piecewise-defined symbolic formulas used in the inversion of the Florescu, et. al. Broken
Ray transform. The resulting *.rpn.bz2 files are provided in this package. The other SAGE
worksheets are data generators, used to simulate data for use as input to the inversions of
both the Florescu, et. al. and Polar BRTs.
